To run all rspec tests, type the following into the terminal:

  ' rspec '

I also tagged each suite of rspec on a class by class basis. If
you only want to run the rspec tests for one class, use one of 
the following commands:

' rspec --tag candy '
' rspec --tag candy_bag '
' rspec --tag restricted_candy_bag '
' rspec --tag analyzer '
' rspec --tag talkable '

*If you have a syntax error in any of your code, rspec will not run
*If you have code that is executing (i.e. not just class and method
 definitions), rspec might not run. Just comment out any driver code
 before you run a test.
