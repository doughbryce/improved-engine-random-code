Write a script called script.js that, when entered into Google's developer tools console and then executed, will result in your own version of the NPR homepage. You must at minimum include:

- New titles on every title (some of them can be the same title)

- New articles (These don't need to be anything fancy, just different then what you see on the page originally).

- New pictures

- At least two different elements that have event listeners on them that change their appearance or adds new elements to the dom. You may add additional elements like buttons if you wish.

When you are finished, submit your script.js here.
