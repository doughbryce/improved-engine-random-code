-----------------------------------------------
Due: Friday, September 29, 2017 at 8:00 am
Now that you understand the basics of positioning and styling, you are ready to create your own website! I will use this project to assess what you have learned so far, so do your best to make your website look as good as possible. Here are some examples of the quality I'm looking for:

Socrative

Remind

Here are the minimum requirements:

Git

- You must have good git workflow on this assignment. Make frequent commit messages.

-For each new feature of your site, create a new branch to work on that feature. Make commits frequently. When that feature is finished, push it up to github and merge it to the master branch by creating a pull request.

Homepage

- Your homepage must be called index.html

- It must have at minimum four different sections.

- Each section should contain text, images, links, etc.

- Each section should be designed well. It should take up a large amount of area, use big text and big pictures.

- You need a footer section

- You need to use at least three different display schemes. Some areas should have only one item centered, others should have two or three colums.

- Choose a font from Google fonts that looks good

- Choose the colors for your color scheme that work well with eachother.

Nav

- You need a nav section that has at minimum three links

- One of those links needs to be a link to the github page that contains the source code for this project.

- Another one of those links needs to take you to a page that has a form (see below for requirements)

- The other links can take you to other pages that you create with whatever content you like. These pages must at minimum take up the entire page.

Page with a form

- One page must contain a form. You must have at least four different types of input fields and a submit button

- Since we haven't learned how to handle http requests, this form should just submit to http://example.com.

Grading

- When I grade your project, I will be looking to see if you met the minimum requirements as outlined above

- I will also be looking for the time and care you put into making your site look clean and consistent. Image sizes should be consistent. Fonts should be consistent. Colors should work together and be consistent.

- You should use large font sizes and pictures.
